# 🚀 Stealth Clip

**Stealth Clip** is a unique Windows utility app designed for freelancers, streamers, and anyone who needs to keep sensitive text (like passwords) hidden from prying eyes—especially from screen capture software like Upwork's screenshot tool or streaming overlays.

## 🕵️‍♂️ Why Stealth Clip?

Most password managers are bulky and require accounts. Stealth Clip is different:
- **Your text stays hidden**—never shown on screen.
- **Copy with a click**—instantly copy your password or secret text to the clipboard without ever displaying it.
- **No accounts, no cloud, no fuss**—just a simple, secure clipboard manager for your desktop.

### 🎯 Use Cases
- **Upwork freelancers**: Hide passwords from regular screenshots taken by the Upwork app.
- **Streamers**: Keep stream keys, passwords, or sensitive info off your stream overlay.
- **Anyone**: Store and copy secrets without exposing them to screen recorders or shoulder surfers.

## ✨ Features
- Secure local storage for your secrets
- Instantly copy any entry to clipboard
- Never displays sensitive text on screen
- Simple, modern UI
- No registration, no cloud, no ads
